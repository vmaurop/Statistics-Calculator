---------------------------------------------------

Calculate and present basic descriptive statistics for a sample data set including:
maximum, minimum, count, sum, average, median, variance,and standard deviation.


Maximum
The largest value in a sample data set.

Minimum
The smallest value in a sample data set.

Count (n)
The total number of data values in a data set.

Average
The sum of all of the data divided by the count;
mean = sum / n.

Median
The numeric value separating the higher half of the ordered sample data from the lower half. If n is odd the median is the center value.  If n is even the median is the average of the 2 center values.(so first we should sort the data)

Variance
The sum of the squared differences between data values and the mean, divided by the count 
[ (x1 - average)2 + (x2 - average)2 + (x3 - average)2 + ... + (xn - average)2 ] / n 

Standard Deviation (s)
The square root of the variance;
2âˆšvariance or variance = s2

So, on click button "calculate" in the form we have all the results for any real number
